Commercial Use
==============

|project| follows the same licensing that Qt has, which means that there are two
distributions, the Community Edition (LGPLv3/GPLv3) and a Commercial Edition. For
more information, check the `Qt Licensing`_ page.

As a brief description, you can get the commercial |project| packages by having
any of the following licenses:

#. Qt for Application Development Professional (ADP)
#. Qt for Application Development Enterprise (ADE)
#. Qt for Device Creation Professional (DCP)
#. Qt for Device Creation Enterprise (DCE)

The only difference is that the ADP license **does not** include the extra
``Qt OPC UA``, ``Qt MQTT`` and ``Qt CoAP`` modules, which are distributed in
a special Python wheel.

|project| follows the same approach as Qt, meaning that commercial
users will have access to both our commercial packages for any
given version, or the special commercial LTS releases.

Commercial users **should not** install the Community Edition distribution via ``pip
install pyside6`` to avoid licensing problems, and should refer to the
packages that can be acquired from the `Qt Account`_, the Qt Installer, or
via the `qtpip` tool.

Installation
------------

We understand that the installation of the commercial wheels will depend
on your use cases. For this, we currently offer three
ways to install a commercial Qt for Python release: a command line tool,
using the Maintenance Tool, or downloading packages by hand.

qtpip - a commercial wheel installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`qtpip`_ is a wrapper around `pip`_ (the package installer for Python) that provides an
integration with the detection of commercial licenses.

To set up the tool, we recommend creating a virtual environment for your
project, and then installing the tool like any other module:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create and activate a virtual environment first
    # then install 'qtpip'
    pip install qtpip

    # Now install pyside6 (or any of the Qt for Python packages)
    qtpip install pyside6

Besides the ``install`` command, you can also ``uninstall`` (like in pip) but
you can also perform a `fulluninstall`` to fully remove all the Qt for Python
packages. You can find more information running ``qtpip -h``::

   $ qtpip -h
   Usage: qtpip [options] install <package> fulluninstall <PySide6/shiboken6/all>
   Qt wrapper around pip.
   These arguments override pip's. For more, refer to pip --help

   Options:
     -f, --force                  Force installation if OSS wheels were already
                                  installed.
     --no-input                   Disable prompting for input.
     --no-cache-dir               Disable the cache.
     --disable-pip-version-check  Don't periodically check PyPI to determine
                                  whether a new version of pip is available for
                                  download.
     --no-color                   Suppress colored output.
     --user                       Install to the Python user install directory for
                                  your platform.
     --force-reinstall            Reinstall all packages even if they are already
                                  up-to-date.
     -h, --help                   Displays help on commandline options.
     --help-all                   Displays help, including generic Qt options.
     -v, --version                Displays version information.

   Arguments:
     install                      Installs a package, this can be any of PySide6,
                                  PySide6-Essentials, PySide6-Addons, shiboken6 or
                                  shiboken6-generator for the respective commercial
                                  wheel, or any other wheel from PyPi.
     fulluninstall                Fully uninstalls all packages related to
                                  PySide6, shiboken6, or both.

.. note:: The release cycle of ``qtpip`` will be independent from the Qt for
   Python one.


Maintenance Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a commercial user, you are able to download the commercial set of wheels
from the `Qt Maintenance Tool`_. The same versions that are available for
Qt/C++ are available for the Python bindings.

The wheels will be downloaded, but not installed, mainly because they should
be installed into a virtual environment rather than the default interpreter.
A ``requirements.txt`` file will be provided alongside the wheels, in order to
simplify the installation step::

   pip install -r /path/to/Qt/QtForPython/6.6.0/requirements.txt

Complementary to the wheels, you will be able to download the sources
as well.

.. note:: Wheels installed this way will be detectable by `Qt Creator`_, which
   will offer you to install them for your current Python interpreter.

Using account.qt.io
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Head to your `Qt Account`_ page, and select the **Download** option on the side
menu. You will find an option to select |project| from the **Products**
section:

.. image:: products.png
   :alt: Products screenshot
   :align: center

There are two options that will list a different set of packages:

* **Qt for Python Commercial wheels** which are the non-LTS releases under
  commercial licensing, and include commercial only features and tools.
  Additionally, here is where you can find the *Qt for automation (M2M
  Protocols)* packages.

* **Qt for Python (Commercial LTS)** where you will find the 5.15.x LTS and 6.2.x
  LTS releases.

Once you select any of those, you will be able to select the version of the
packages you want to download for the **Qt for Python Commercial wheels** packages:

.. image:: versions_commercial.png
   :alt: Commercial versions screenshot
   :align: center

and the **Qt for Python (Commercial LTS)** packages:

.. image:: versions_lts.png
   :alt: LTS versions screenshot
   :align: center

For any of the versions, you can download many packages depending on your
Operating System (macOS, Windows, or Linux). To learn more about what the
packages contain, please check the :ref:`package_details` page.

Once you download the packages, you are encouraged to create a Python virtual
environment to install them - check the :ref:`getting-started` page for how to do
it.
With your activated environment on a terminal, run the following command (for
macOS/Linux)::

    pip install *.whl

to install them all, and leave ``pip`` to resolve the dependencies among the
packages, or for Windows do it by hand selecting the proper combination::

    pip install shiboken6-... PySide6_Essentials-... PySide6-Addons... ...

Alternatively for Windows, you can specify the following command which includes
the version, and assumes that you are running it on the same directory where
the wheels are::

    pip install --no-index --find-links=. PySide6==6.4.0.commercial

.. note:: As described in the :ref:`package_details` page, the dependency
   of the packages requires you to first install the ``shiboken6``
   package, and then ``shiboken6-generator`` in case you are interested
   on binding generation; or ``PySide6_Essentials`` in case you want
   to use the essential modules. After the Essentials, you can optionally
   install the ``PySide6_Addons`` and ``PySide6_M2M`` depending on your
   needs.

Qt Creator Integration
----------------------

*Qt Creator* offers the option to create new |project| projects from the main
wizard.

To execute the projects, make sure that the proper *Python Interpreter* is
selected, so *Qt Creator* can use the commercial modules you just installed.
Go to *Edit -> Preferences* where you can find the *Python* option
that will show the following:

.. image:: qtcreator_python.png
   :alt: Qt Creator Python options
   :align: center

you can add, remove and modify environments. To include a new one, make sure to
select the main Python executable from your environment. This can be found on
``path_to_your_env/bin/python`` (macOS and Linux), or
``path_to_your_env\python.exe`` (Windows).

As an alternative, you can launch *Qt Creator* from within the virtual
environment, detecting your installation automatically.

Migrating from other versions
-----------------------------

In case you have a virtual environment with the Open Source distribution, you
need to first uninstall those packages with the ``pip uninstall <package>``
command.

To check if packages are installed, run ``pip list`` and look for
``shiboken`` or ``PySide`` packages.

We always recommend creating a new virtual environment, so in doubt it is
better to just remove the old ones if you have previous installations. The
nature of virtual environments is volatile by design.


Python Workflow
---------------

The Qt framework is a C++ framework that we expose to Python with the help of
Shiboken (binding generator), which allows us to create the PySide Python module.

|project| tries to find a middle ground between how C++ and Python projects
work, so there are many decisions that need to be made, one of them being that
the distributing of the packages needs to follow the same Python workflow,
which means creating Python packages (wheels) and distributing them in a way
people can use the ``pip`` tool to install them.

PyPi is the main platform to distribute Open Source packages, but when
commercial packages are required the situation is different. Among all the
alternatives we had, we initially decided to provide the packages (wheels) on
the `Qt Account`_ platform, so people can download and install on demand, but
we are investigating simple ways to improve this process.

There have also been discussions regarding including |project| in the *Qt
Maintenance Tool* but this creates a new level of complexity. The reasoning is
that the tool would require people to select or create a Python virtual
environment on a separate location for this to be installed. Additionally,
the Python workflow considers virtual environments as very volatile. This means
they get removed and created often, so reinstalling or updating the |project|
packages will likely happen.
